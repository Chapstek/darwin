            <h2>My First Access Control Project at Netone: A Journey of Growth and Leadership</h2>
            <p class="date">April 10, 2025</p>
            <p>On April 10, 2025, I stood outside the IHS Zambia HQ offices, shaking hands with Mukuka, a colleague who had been instrumental in guiding me through a transformative experience. The photo captured a moment of pride and accomplishment the handover day of my first access control project with Netone, where I not only participated but eventually took on the role of technical lead. This project, which involved the installation of endpoint access control devices and the configuration of employee cards for IHS Zambia, was a steep learning curve filled with challenges, growth, and invaluable lessons.</p>
            
            <h3>Stepping into the World of Access Control</h3>
            <p>When I first joined the Netone team, I was eager to dive into the world of access control systems. I had a foundational understanding of the technology, but this project was my first real hands on experience. IHS Zambia, a key client, needed a robust system to secure their facilities, ensuring that only authorized personnel could access specific areas. The scope of the project included installing endpoint access control devices such as card readers and biometric scanners at various entry points and configuring access cards for all employees.</p>
            <p>I started as a team member, shadowing more experienced colleagues like Mukuka, who had a wealth of knowledge in access control systems. My initial tasks were straightforward: assisting with the physical installation of devices, running cables, and ensuring the hardware was properly mounted. However, as the project progressed, I quickly realized that access control was far more complex than I had anticipated. It was not just about installing hardware; it required a deep understanding of network integration, software configuration, and user management.</p>
            
            <h3>Rising to the Challenge: Becoming the Technical Lead</h3>
            <p>Midway through the project, an unexpected turn of events thrust me into the role of technical lead. Our original lead had to step away due to personal reasons, and with a tight deadline looming, I was asked to step up. At first, I was overwhelmed. I had never led a project of this scale, and the responsibility of ensuring everything ran smoothly felt daunting. However, I saw this as an opportunity to grow, and with Mukuka’s support, I took on the challenge.</p>
            <p>As the technical lead, my role expanded significantly. I was now responsible for overseeing the entire installation process, configuring the access control software, and ensuring that each employee’s card was correctly programmed with the appropriate access levels. I also had to coordinate with the IHS Zambia team to understand their specific security needs and ensure the system met their expectations.</p>
            
            <h3>Facing Challenges Head-On</h3>
            <p>The transition to technical lead came with its fair share of challenges. One of the biggest hurdles was troubleshooting connectivity issues between the access control devices and the central server. Several devices failed to sync properly, which meant employees could not access certain areas. I spent hours poring over manuals, testing different configurations, and consulting with Mukuka to identify the root cause. Eventually, we discovered that the issue stemmed from a misconfigured IP address in the system settings a small oversight that had a significant impact.</p>
            <p>Another challenge was managing the configuration of hundreds of employee cards. Each card needed to be programmed with specific access permissions based on the employee’s role, and any errors could result in security breaches or operational disruptions. I quickly learned the importance of double checking every detail and maintaining clear communication with the IHS Zambia team to ensure accuracy.</p>
            <p>Time management was also a struggle. With the handover deadline approaching, I had to balance the technical aspects of the project with administrative tasks like updating project documentation and training the IHS Zambia staff on how to use the system. There were moments when I felt overwhelmed, but I leaned on my team for support and focused on tackling one task at a time.</p>
            
            <h3>Learning and Growing Through Adversity</h3>
            <p>Despite the challenges, this project was a crash course in access control systems and project management. I learned how to troubleshoot complex technical issues, manage a team under pressure, and communicate effectively with clients. One of the most valuable lessons was the importance of adaptability. In a field like access control, where technology and client needs are constantly evolving, being able to think on your feet is crucial.</p>
            <p>I also gained a deeper appreciation for collaboration. Mukuka, in particular, was a mentor throughout the project, offering guidance and encouragement when I needed it most. His expertise helped me navigate the more technical aspects of the system, and his confidence in my abilities gave me the push I needed to succeed as a technical lead.</p>
            
            <h3>The Handover Day: A Moment of Pride</h3>
            <p>By the time April 10, 2025, rolled around, the access control system at IHS Zambia was fully operational. All devices were installed and functioning, the employee cards were configured, and the IHS Zambia team was trained on how to manage the system. The handover ceremony was a moment of celebration, not just for the successful completion of the project but for the personal growth I had experienced along the way.</p>
            <p>Standing outside the IHS Zambia HQ offices, I shook Mukuka’s hand, holding the project documentation that symbolized the culmination of weeks of hard work. The clear blue sky and modern glass building in the background reflected the bright future I now saw for myself in this field. I had not only delivered a secure and efficient access control system for IHS Zambia but had also proven to myself that I was capable of leading a project of this magnitude.</p>

            <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
            <p>This project was a defining moment in my career. It taught me the importance of resilience, attention to detail, and the value of teamwork. As I move forward, I am excited to take on more access control projects with Netone, armed with the knowledge and confidence I gained from this experience. I’m also committed to mentoring others, just as Mukuka mentored me, to help them navigate their own challenges and grow in this dynamic field.</p>
            <p>To anyone embarking on their first access control project, my advice is simple: embrace the challenges, ask questions, and never stop learning. The road may be tough, but the rewards of both personal growth and professional success are well worth it.</p>
